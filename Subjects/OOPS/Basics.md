# OOPS Basics

<br>

### What is OOPS ?
OOP (object-oriented programming) is a programming paradigm which involves creation of classes and objects. The main aim of OOP is to bind data together and the functions that operate on them. It organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

**Note: OOPs follow Bottom-Up Approach**

<br>

#### Real World Example
Lets take an example of mobile phones. Class refers to a category of some entity. Here Mobile will be our class, and its instances (or phones) will become our objects. Now one object is a collection of data and member functions. In our example, phone specs will be the object data and its features which defines the characteristic of any object will be our function such as take_photo(), call(), message(), shutdown() etc.

```
public class Phone{
    public string Name {get; set;}
    public int IMINumber {get; set;}
    public string Type {get; set;}
    
    public void Dial{
    }
    
    public void SendMassage{
    }
}
```

### Benefits of using OOPS ?
1. Modularity
2. Reusability
3. Productivity
4. Easily upgradable and scalable
5. Security
6. Flexibility due to Polymorphism

<br>

### Limitations of OOPs
1. The length of the programmes developed using OOP language is much larger than the procedural approach.
2. Programs are typically slower than procedure based programs, as they typically require more instructions to be executed.
3. Not suitable for all types of problems.

<br>

### OOPs is well suited for ?
This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.

<br>

### What does keyword `Namespace` do ?
It defines a scope for the identifiers that are used in the program. 

<br>

### Scope Resolution Operator `::`
C and C++ are block structured language. Same variable names can be used to have different meanings in different blocks. The scope of the variable extends from the point of its declaration till the end of the block containing the declaration.

Global version of variable cannot be accessed from within the inner block. The scope resolution operator is used to uncover a hidden variable. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int m = 10;     // --> global 

int main(){

    int m = 20;     // --> local to main()
    
    {
        int k = m;
        int m = 30;     // --> local to inner block
        
        cout<< k <<" "<< m <<" "<< ::m<<endl;
    }
    
    cout<< m << ::m<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Output:

20 30 10

20 10

Note: `::m` will always refer to global m

### Cohesion Vs Coupling
Cohesion refers to what the class (or module) can do. Low cohesion would mean that the class does a great variety of actions - it is broad, unfocused on what it should do. High cohesion means that the class is focused on what it should be doing, i.e. only methods relating to the intention of the class.

Coupling refers to how related or dependent two classes/modules are toward each other. For low coupled classes, changing something major in one class should not affect the other. High coupling would make it difficult to change and maintain your code; since classes are closely knit together, making a change could require an entire system revamp.

### Memory management operators in C/C++
We use dynamic allocation techniques when it is not known in advance, how much memory space is needed. C uses `malloc()` and `calloc()` functions to allocate memory dynamically at runtime. Similarily it uses `free()` function to free dynamically allocated memory. 

In C++, an object can be created by `new` and destroyed by `delete`. 

<br>

#### malloc() 
1. malloc() allocates memory block of given size (in bytes) and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block.
2. malloc() doesn’t initialize the allocated memory. If we try to access the content of memory block(before initializing) then we’ll get segmentation fault error(or maybe garbage values).

<br>

#### calloc()
1. calloc() can be thought of as being a (thin) wrapper on top of malloc(). It allocate multiple blocks of given size.
2. Unlike malloc(), calloc() takes two arguments: Number of blocks to be allocated, Size of each block. Hence, 
3. calloc() initializes the allocated memory block to zero.

<br>

#### malloc Vs calloc
The calloc() function is generally more suitable and efficient than that of the malloc() function. While both the functions are used to allocate memory space, calloc() can allocate multiple blocks at a single time. You don’t have to request for a memory block every time. The calloc() function is used in complex data structures which require larger memory space.

<br>

#### realloc()
Using the C realloc() function, you can add more memory size to already allocated memory. It expands the current block while leaving the original content as it is. It can also be used to reduce the size of the previously allocated memory.

<br>

#### free()
The memory for variables is automatically deallocated at compile time. In dynamic memory allocation, you have to deallocate memory explicitly. If not done, you may encounter out of memory error. The free() function is called to release/deallocate memory in C


<br>

#### new Vs malloc()
1. It automatically computes size of data object.
2. It automatically returns correct pointer type, so no need to typecast.
3. Like any other operator, new and delete can be overloaded.

<br>

#### [delete Vs free()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-30/)
In C++, delete operator should only be used either for the pointers pointing to the memory allocated using new operator or for a NULL pointer, and free() should only be used either for the pointers pointing to the memory allocated using malloc() or for a NULL pointer.

The most important reason why free() should not be used for de-allocating memory allocated using NEW is that, it does not call the destructor of that object while delete operator does.
