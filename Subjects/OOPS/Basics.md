# OOPS Basics

<br>

### What is OOPS ?
OOP (object-oriented programming) is a programming paradigm which involves creation of classes and objects. The main aim of OOP is to bind data together and the functions that operate on them. It organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

#### Real World Example
Lets take an example of mobile phones. Class refers to a category of some entity. Here Mobile will be our class, and its instances (or phones) will become our objects. Now one object is a collection of data and member functions. In our example, phone specs will be the object data and its features which defines the characteristic of any object will be our function such as take_photo(), call(), message(), shutdown() etc.

```
public class Phone{
    public string Name {get; set;}
    public int IMINumber {get; set;}
    public string Type {get; set;}
    
    public void Dial{
    }
    
    public void SendMassage{
    }
}
```

### Benefits of using OOPS ?
1. Modularity
2. Reusability
3. Productivity
4. Easily upgradable and scalable
5. Security
6. Flexibility due to Polymorphism

<br>

### Limitations of OOPs
1. The length of the programmes developed using OOP language is much larger than the procedural approach.
2. Programs are typically slower than procedure based programs, as they typically require more instructions to be executed.
3. Not suitable for all types of problems.

### OOPs is well suited for ?
This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.
