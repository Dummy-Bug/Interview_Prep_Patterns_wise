# Storage & File Management


### 1. What is File
A file is the smallest allotment of logical secondary storage. Data cannot be written to secondary storage unless they are within a file.

<br>

### 2. What is File System
It is a logical disk component, which contains information about file size, file name, file location fragment information, and where disk data is stored and also describes how a user or application may access the data. The operations like metadata, file naming, storage management, and directories/folders are all managed by the file system. Files are often managed in a hierarchy.

On a storage device, files are stored in sectors in which data is stored in groups of sectors called blocks. The size and location of the files are identified by the file system, and it also helps to recognize which sectors are ready to be used.

Sometimes the term "file system" is used in the reference of partitions. For instance, saying, "on the hard drive, two files systems are available", it means two separate partitions are there (having two different file systems) that use the same physical disk.

A file system is required by most of the applications therefore, each partition should have one. Furthermore, if a program is built for macOS, you will be unable to use this on windows because programs are file system-dependent.

NTFS is most common file system for windows.

### 3. How information is stored in Hard disks ?

1. Hard disks provide the bulk of storage for modern computers. 
2. Each disk platter has a flat circular shape.
3. Bits are stored magnetically on the platters.
4. A read-write head flies over a platter.
5. The arm moves the heads together.
6. The surface of the platter is divided into circular tracks.
7. Tracks are subdivided into sectors.
8. The set of tracks at one arm position consist a cylinder.
9. There are thousands of cylinders in a disk and hundreds of sectors in a track.
10. The outermost cylinder is denoted cylinder 0.
11. A motor rotates the disk at a high speed.

### 4. Disk Scheduling
Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling. Following are some terms related to disk scheduling:

<br>

**Seek Time**

Seek time is the time taken to locate the disk arm to a specified track where the data is to be read or write. So the **disk scheduling algorithm that gives minimum average seek time is better**.

<br>

**Rotational Latency**

Rotational Latency is the time taken by the desired sector of disk to rotate into a position so that it can access the read/write heads. So the disk scheduling algorithm that gives minimum rotational latency is better.

<br>

**Transfer Time**

Transfer time is the time to transfer the data. It depends on the rotating speed of the disk and number of bytes to be transferred.

<br>

**Disk Access Time**

Disk Access Time = Seek Time + Rotational Latency + Transfer Time

<br>

**Disk Response Time** 

Response Time is the average of time spent by a request waiting to perform its I/O operation. Average Response time is the response time of the all requests.

### 5. Disk Scheduling Algorithms
1. First come first served (FCFS) scheduling
2. Shortest-seek-time-first (SSTF) scheduling
3. SCAN scheduling (elevator algorithm)
4. C-SCAN scheduling
5. LOOK scheduling
6. C-LOOK scheduling
