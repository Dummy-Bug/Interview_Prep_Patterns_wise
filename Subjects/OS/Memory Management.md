# Memory Management

<br>

### 1. Which memories are directly accessible by CPU ?
Registers and RAM

<br>

### 2. Logical Address Vs Physical Address
**Logical Address** is generated by CPU while a program is running. This address is used as a reference to access the physical memory location by CPU.

**Physical Address** identifies a physical location of required data in a memory. The user program generates the logical address and thinks that the program is running in this logical address but the program needs physical memory for its execution, therefore, the logical address must be mapped to the physical address by MMU before they are used.

<br>

### 3. How to convert Logical address to physical address ?
The hardware device called **Memory Management Unit** is used for mapping logical address to its corresponding physical address. 

<br>

### 4. Purpose of logical address ?
Because this gives the Operating System a way to securely manage memory.

<br>

### 5. Why is secure memory management necessary?
Imagine you are editing an important letter in MS Word while listening to music on YouTube on a very recently released browser. The browser is buggy and writes bogus values to a range of physical addresses that were being used by the Word program to store the edits of your letter. All of that information is corrupt!

**How can the OS prevent this?**

Maintain a mapping of physical addresses allocated to each process and make sure one process cannot access the memory allocated to another process.

<br>

### 6. Fragmentation
Fragmentation means wastage of memory.

**Internal Fragmentation**

1. Internal Fragmentation occurs due to wastage of memory inside the block in fixed memory Partitioning. 
2. Paging suffers from Internal fragmentation.

**External Fragmentation**

1. It occurs due to contiguos allocation of memory in variable partitioning.
2. Segmentation suffers from external fragmentation.

<br>

### 7. Paging increases context switch time how and why ?
OS must keep track of each individual process's page table, updating it whenever the process's pages get moved in and out of memory, and applying the correct page table when processing system calls for a particular process. This all increases the overhead involved when swapping processes in and out of the CPU. 

<br>

### 8. How Paging Works ?
Processes are divided into pages and main memory is divided into frames. Now The CPU generates the logical address, which contains the page number and the page offset. The page number is used to index into the page table, to get the corresponding page frame number, and once we have the page frame of the physical memory(also called main memory), we can apply the page offset to get the right word of memory.

<br>

### 9. Why TLB (Translation Look Aside Buffer) ?
The thing is that page table is stored in physical memory, and sometimes can be very large, so to speed up the translation of logical address to physical address, we sometimes use TLB, which is made of expensive and faster associative memory, So instead of going into page table first, we go into the TLB and use page number to index into the TLB, and get the corresponding page frame number and if it is found, we completely avoid page table( because we have both the page frame number and the page offset) and form the physical address.

**TLB Miss:** If we don't find the page frame number inside the TLB, it is called a TLB miss only then we go to the page table to look for the corresponding page frame number.

**TLB Hit:** If we find the page frame number in TLB, its called TLB hit, and we don't need to go to page table.

<br>

### 10. Page Fault
Occurs when the page accessed by a running program is not present in physical memory. It means the page is present in the secondary memory but not yet loaded into a frame of physical memory.

<br>

### 11. What is Cache Hit and Cache Miss ?
Cache Memory is a small memory that operates at a faster speed than physical memory and we always go to cache before we go to physical memory. If we are able to locate the corresponding word in cache memory inside the cache, its called **cache hit** and we don't even need to go to the physical memory. If cache memory is unable to find the corresponding block, then we go to physical memory and do all that process of going through page table or TLB.

### 12. Whole control flow (IMP)
[Explaination](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37825859/cache-miss-a-tlb-miss-and-page-fault)

1.First go to the cache memory and if its a cache hit, then we are done.
2. If its a cache miss, go to step 3.
3. First go to TLB and if its a TLB hit, go to physical memory using physical address formed, we are done.
4. If its a TLB miss, then go to page table to get the frame number of your page for forming the physical address.
5. If the page  is not found, its a page fault. Use one of the page replacement algorithms if all the frames are occupied by some page else just load the required page from secondary memory to physical memory frame.
