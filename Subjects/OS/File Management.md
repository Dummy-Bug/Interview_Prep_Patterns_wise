# File Management

<br>

### 1. File System
It is a logical disk component, which contains information about file size, file name, file location fragment information, and where disk data is stored and also describes how a user or application may access the data. The operations like metadata, file naming, storage management, and directories/folders are all managed by the file system. Files are often managed in a hierarchy.

On a storage device, files are stored in sectors in which data is stored in groups of sectors called blocks. The size and location of the files are identified by the file system, and it also helps to recognize which sectors are ready to be used.

Sometimes the term "file system" is used in the reference of partitions. For instance, saying, "on the hard drive, two files systems are available", it means two separate partitions are there (having two different file systems) that use the same physical disk.

A file system is required by most of the applications therefore, each partition should have one. Furthermore, if a program is built for macOS, you will be unable to use this on windows because programs are file system-dependent.

NTFS is most common file system for windows.
