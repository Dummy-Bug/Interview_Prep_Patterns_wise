### 1. What are Threads?
A thread is a path of execution within a process. A process can contain multiple threads. A thread consists of its own program counter (keeps track of which instruction to execute next), a stack (contains the history of execution) , and a set of registers (hold its current working variables). 

**Why Threads ?**

Threads are a popular way to improve the performance of an application through parallelism. In the implementation of network servers and web servers threads have been successfully used. In a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads.

<br>

### 2. Which segments do Threads share?
**Everything except stack and registers**

A Thread shares same address space, code section, data section and same global variables (heap memory), same files (file discriptors)

```
           Process   Thread

   Stack   private   private
   Heap    private   shared
   Data    private   shared
   Code    private   shared
```

<br>

### 3. Can Multiple threads run simultaneously ?
No, The CPU switches rapidly back and forth among the threads giving the illusion that the threads are running in parallel.

<br>

### 4. What are advantages of using threads ?
1. Better utilization of resources.
2. Creating and managing threads becomes easier.
3. Context Switching is smooth.
4. Responsiveness
5. Communication between multiple threads is easier.

<br>

### 5. Difference between Process and Thread
1. Processes are typically independent while threads exist as parts of a process.
2. Processes have separate address spaces, whereas threads share their address space
3. Context switching between threads in the same process is typically faster than context switching between processes
4. If a process gets blocked then the remaining processes can continue their execution, while if a user-level thread gets blocked, all of its peer threads also get blocked.

<br>

### 6. User Threads Vs Kernel Threads

**User Threads**
1. These are the threads that application programmers use in their programs.
2. If one user-level thread performs a blocking operation then the entire process will be blocked.
3. Context switch requires no hardware support.


**Kernel Threads**
1. These threads are implemented within OS Kernels.
2. If one kernel thread performs a blocking operation then another thread can continue the execution.
3. Context switch requires hardware support.

<br>

### 7. Concurrency vs Parallelism
In Parallelism we execute different processes exactly at the same time on multiple processors, while Concurrency means we are executing multiple programs on single processors by switching rapidly among them giving an illusion of parallel execution.

<br>

### 8. Thread Libraries
Thread libraries provide APIs for the creation and management of threads. Thread libraries may be implemented either in user space or in kernel space. Some common libs are:
1. **POSIX or Ptheads** may be provided as either a user or kernel library, as an extension to the POSIX standard.
2. **Win32 threads** are provided as a kernel-level library on Windows systems.

<br>

### 9. Pthreads Vs Threads
If you want to run code on many platforms, go for Posix Threads. They are available almost everywhere and are quite mature. On the other hand if you only use Linux/gcc, thread is perfectly fine, it has a higher abstraction level, a really good interface and plays nicely with other C++11 classes.

<br>

### 10. What are some best examples of multithreaded applications? 
1. **Web Browsers** - A web browser can download any number of files and web pages (multiple tabs) at the same time and still lets you continue browsing.
2. **Web Servers** - A threaded web server handles each request with a new thread. There is a thread pool and every time a new request comes in, it is assigned to a thread from the thread pool.
3. **Text Editors & IDEs** - When you are typing in an editor, spell-checking, formatting of text and saving the text are done concurrently by multiple threads.
4. **VLC Media Player** - When you open the media player, you play a song and at the same time you kept on adding new songs to the list, displaying ads, searching for a new song.

<br>

### 11. Issues with Multithreading

**Thread Cancellation**

Thread cancellation means terminating a thread before it has finished working. There can be two approaches for this, one is **Asynchronous cancellation**, which terminates the target thread immediately. The other is **Deferred cancellation** allows the target thread to periodically check if it should be canceled.

**Signal Handling**

Signals are used in UNIX systems to notify a process that a particular event has occurred. Now in when a Multithreaded process receives a signal, to which thread it must be delivered? 

**fork() System Call**

fork() is a system call executed in the kernel through which a process creates a copy of itself. Now the problem in the Multithreaded process is, if one thread forks, will the entire process be copied or not?

**Security Issues**

Yes, there can be security issues because of the extensive sharing of resources between multiple threads.

<br>

### 12. Effect of Cores on Multithreading
Multicore refers to a computer or processor that has more than one logical CPU core, that can physically execute multiple instructions at the same time. Programs that support multithreading can use more than one core if available.

**Only one thread can run on a core at once. Different threads running is actually just threads jumping onto the CPU and running for short periods of time, then being switched out with other threads which also need to run.**

Note: The CPU cores mean the actual hardware component whereas threads refer to the virtual component which manages the tasks.

<br>

**Can we do multithreading on Single Core Processor ?**

Yes, even if we have only one core, we can still run multiple threads, and our OS will do its best to make sure that all running threads get their fair share of CPU time.

<br>

**Hyperthreading**

Hyper-threading was Intel’s first effort to bring parallel computation to end user’s PCs. A single CPU with hyper-threading appears as two logical CPUs for an operating system. When a "core" has two "threads" (like in many new Intel chips), it means that the core can run two parallel threads, as if there were two cores.

<br>

**Is there a benefit to running a parallelizable process on more threads than cores?**

If your threads don't do I/O, synchronization etc, 1 thread per core will get you the best performance. However that's very rare in real scenario. Adding more threads usually helps, but after some point, they cause performance degradation due to more context switches.

<br>

### 13. Multithreading in C++
Header: `#include <thread>`

Syntax for creating new thread: `thread t(callable_object, arg1, arg2, ..)` 

This creates a new thread of execution associated with t, which calls callable_object(arg1, arg2). The callable object (i.e. a function pointer, a lambda expression, the instance of a class with a function call operator) is immediately invoked by the new thread, with the (optionally) passed arguments. By default they are copied, if you want to pass by reference you have to warp the argument using std::ref(arg).

Note: a thread object is just movable, not copyable.

<br>

**Single Thread Implementation**

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void print(int n, const string &str)  {  
    cout<<"Printing integer: "<<n<<endl;  
    cout<<"Printing string: " <<str<<endl;  
} 

int main() {
    thread t1(print, 10, "Educative.blog");            // --> will create new thread t
    t1.join();                                         // --> will join thread t to main thread
    return 0;
}
```

Here, join() will pause the main function’s thread until the specified thread, in this case t1, has finished its task. Without join() here, the main thread would finish its task before t1 would complete print, resulting in an error.

<br>

**MultiThreading Implementation**

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void print(int n, const string &str)  {
    string msg = to_string(n) + " : " + str + "\n";
    cout<<msg;
}
 
int main() {
    vector<string> s = {"Educative.blog", "Educative", "courses", "are great"};
    vector<thread> threads;
 
    for(int i=0; i<s.size(); i++){
        threads.push_back(thread(print, i, s[i]));                // --> will create new threads and append them to thread vector
    }
    
    for(auto &th : threads)                                       // --> will iterate on every thread and join them to main thread
        th.join();
    
    return 0;
}
```

Here we used a for loop to initialize multiple threads, pass them the print function and arguments, which they then complete concurrently. This multithreading option would be faster one using only the main thread as more of the total CPU is being used.

<br>

### 14. Join() and Detach()
If the main thread exits, all the secondary threads still running suddenly terminate, without any possibility of recovery. To prevent this to happen, the parent thread has two options for each child:
1. Blocks and waits for the child termination, by invoking the **join()** method on the child.
2. Explicitly declaring that the child can continue its execution even after the parent’s exit, using the **detach()** method.

<br>

### 15. What is Thread Safe ?
Thread-safe code is code that will work even if many Threads are executing it simultaneously.

<br>

### 16. Why static variables are considered evil ?
1. Since statics live in one space, they are not by defualt thread safe. We need to use synchonisation mechanism to handle them.
2. We can't control statics in terms of creation and destruction.
3. Also they violates the principle of OOPS that data is encapsulated within objects.
4. Statics have a lifetime that matches the entire runtime of the program. This means, even once we are done using the class, the memory from all those static variables cannot be garbage collected.
