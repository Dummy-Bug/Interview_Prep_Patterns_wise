# How Packet Travels ?

<br>

## The OSI Model
OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. It is a set of 7 layers which combine to accomplish the end-goal of Computer to Computer communication.

## @ Layer 1 : Physical layer
1. The Physical layer of the OSI model is responsible for the transfer of bits. 
2. The actual format of the data on the “wire” can vary with each medium. In the case of Ethernet, bits are transferred in the form of electric pulses. In the case of Wifi, bits are transferred in the form of radio waves. In the case of Fiber, bits are transferred in the form of pulses of light.
3. Aside from the physical cable, Repeaters and Hubs also operate at this layer. 
4. **Repeater** simply repeats a signal and increase the range a signal can travel beyond the single cable limit. 
5. **Hub** is a multi-port Repeater. If four devices are connected to Hub, anything sent by one device gets repeated to the other three.


**Simply put, Layer 1 is anything that carries 1’s and 0’s between two nodes.**

## @ Layer 2 : Data Link layer
1. Data Link layer is responsible for interfacing with the Physical layer. 
2. The **Network Interface Card (NIC)** that you plug your Ethernet wire into handles the Layer 2 functionality. It receives signals from the wire, and transmits signals on to the wire.
3. Layer 2 will then group together those 1’s and 0’s into chunks known as Frames.
4. The **MAC address** uniquely identifies each individual NIC. Each NIC is pre-configured with a MAC address by the manufacturer.


**The role of Layer 2 is to deliver packets from hop to hop.**

<br>


## @ Layer 3 : Network layer
1. It uses **IP address** to logically identify every node connected to the Internet. It is considered logical because an IP address is not a permanent identification of a computer.
2. **Routers** operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model. A Router’s primary responsibility is to facilitate communication between Networks.
3. Router creates a boundary between two networks. In order to communicate with any device not directly in your network, a router must be used.


**Network layer of the OSI model is responsible for packet delivery from end to end.**

### Q. If we already have MAC addresses, then why do we need IP addresses ?
Both addressing schemes accomplish different functions:

**MAC Address** 
1. It is a globally unique ID for our device.
2. Usefull and efficient for local communications.
3. As more computers joined internet, communication became impossible using MAC address. Hence IP came into picture!


**IP Address**
1. It can group and organize computers in different networks.
2. It is flexible and changeable - making a device mobile.

```
Hence, 

MAC address tells us "Who You Are"  --> (Which will never change)
IP address tells us "Where You Are" --> (Which can change)

They both work together to make sure that message gets delivered to the right person on right network.

1. Layer 2 uses MAC addresses and is responsible for packet delivery from hop to hop.
2. Layer 3 uses IP addresses and is responsible for packet delivery from end to end.


Between each Router, the MAC address header is stripped and regenerated to get it to the next hop. The IP header generated by the first computer is only stripped off by the final computer, hence the IP header handled the “end to end” delivery, and each of the four different MAC headers involved in this animation handled the “hop to hop” delivery.

## @ Layer 4 : Transport layer
1. It is responsible for distinguishing network streams.
2. Two methods of distinguishing network streams exist. They are known as the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**, or the **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**.
3. A unique application stream is identified by both Source and Destination port (in combination with their Source and Destination IP address).


**Layer 4 is responsible for service to service delivery.**

### Q. What is the Need of Transport Layer ?

At any given time on a user’s computer there might be an Internet browser open, while music is being streamed, while a messenger or chat app is running. Each of these applications are sending and receiving data from the Internet, and all that data is arriving in the form of 1’s and 0’s on to that computer’s NIC.

Something has to exist in order to distinguish which 1’s and 0’s belong to the messenger or the browser or the streaming music. That “something” is Layer 4. Layer 4 accomplishes this by using an addressing scheme known as **Port Numbers**. Both TCP and UDP have 65,536 port numbers!
