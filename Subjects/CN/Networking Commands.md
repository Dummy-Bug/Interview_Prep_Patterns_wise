# Some Basic Networking Commands

<br>

### Ping 
1. The ping command is used to test the ability of source computer to reach a specified destination computer. It's usually used to verify that a computer can communicate over the network with another computer or network device.
2. The ping command **operates by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request messages** to the destination computer and waiting for a response. How many of those responses are returned, and how long it takes for them to return, are the two major pieces of information that the ping command provides.

Syntax: `ping <IP> or <website_name>`
