# Bit Manipulation

## Easy

#### 1. Power of Two

Hint: If a number is power of 2 then it has only 1 set bit in its binary representation

```cpp
bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
    if(n<0) return false;

    int cnt = 0;  
    while(n){
        if(n&1)
            cnt++;
        n>>=1;
    }

    return cnt==1;
}
```

#### 2. Hamming Distance
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

```cpp
int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
    int cnt = 0;

    while(x>0 or y>0){
        int bit_x = x&1;
        int bit_y = y&1;

        cnt += bit_x xor bit_y;

        x>>=1;
        y>>=1;
    }

    return cnt;
}
```

#### 3. Counting Bits
Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

Input: n = 5

Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]

**Approach 1 : Bit Counting**

```cpp
int countSetBits(int num){
    int cnt = 0;

    while(num>0){ 
        cnt += num&1;
        num>>=1;
    }

    return cnt;
}


vector<int> countBits(int n) {
    vector<int> res;

    for(int i=0; i<=n; i++)
        res.push_back(countSetBits(i));

    return res;
}
```

**Approach 2 : Using DP**

[Explaination](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/discuss/800456/C%2B%2B-or-Counting-Bits-or-O(N)-Explanation)

1. If the number is even, the number of 1s is equal to the number which is half of it. That is because number i is just left shift by 1 bit from number i / 2.
2. If the numbers are odd, The number of 1 bits is equal to the number (i - 1) plus 1.

```cpp
vector<int> countBits(int n) {
    vector<int> res;
    res.push_back(0);

    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){

        /* If i is ODD */

        if(i&1) 
            res.push_back(res[i-1]+1);

        /* If i is EVEN */

        else 
            res.push_back(res[i/2]);
    }

    return res;
}
```
