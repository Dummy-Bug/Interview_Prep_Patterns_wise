# Problems on Knapsack Pattern

### @ 0-1 Knapsack (Parent Problem)
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property)

Complexity Analysis: 

1. Time Complexity: O(N*W) 
-> As redundant calculations of states are avoided.

2. Auxiliary Space: O(N*W) 
-> The use of 2D array data structure for storing intermediate states

```cpp
int solve (int wt[], int val[], int w, int n, int idx, vector<vector<int>> & dp){
    if(idx==n or w==0)
        return 0;

    if(dp[idx][w]!=-1) return dp[idx][w];

    /* If weight of current item <= knapsack, then we have two choices */

    if (wt[idx]<=w){
        int p1 = val[idx] + solve (wt, val, w-wt[idx], n, idx+1, dp);       //--> Either include that item
        int p2 = solve (wt, val, w, n, idx+1, dp);                          //--> Or Not include that item
        return dp[idx][w] = max(p1, p2);    
    }

    /* Else we can't include that item */

    else{
        int p1 = solve (wt, val, w, n, idx+1, dp);
        return dp[idx][w] = p1;
    }
}


int knapSack(int w, int wt[], int val[], int n) { 

    /* Make dp for only those variable which are changing */

    vector<vector<int>> dp (n+1, vector<int> (w+1, -1));

    return solve (wt, val, w, n, 0, dp);
}
```
