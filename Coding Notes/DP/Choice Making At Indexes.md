# Problems based on making choices at each index

### 1. Count Sorted Vowel Strings
Given an integer n, return the number of strings of length n that consist only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and are lexicographically sorted. A string s is lexicographically sorted if for all valid i, s[i] is the same as or comes before s[i+1] in the alphabet.

Input: n = 2
Output: 15 (["aa","ae","ai","ao","au","ee","ei","eo","eu","ii","io","iu","oo","ou","uu"])

```cpp
int solve (int n, int idx, int choices, vector<vector<int>> & dp){
    if(idx==n) return 1;

    if(dp[idx][choices]!=-1) return dp[idx][choices];

    int ans = 0;

    for(int i=choices; i<5; i++)
        ans += solve(n, idx+1, i, dp);

    return dp[idx][choices] = ans;
}

int countVowelStrings(int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp (n+1, vector<int> (5, -1));
    return solve (n, 0, 0, dp);        
}
```
