### Easy

#### 1. Climbing Stairs
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

```cpp
int solve (int n, vector<int> & dp){
    if(n<0) return 0;
    if(n==0) return 1;

    if(dp[n]!=-1) 
        return dp[n];

    return dp[n] = solve(n-1, dp) + solve(n-2, dp);
}

int climbStairs(int n) {
    vector<int> dp (n+1, -1);
    return solve (n, dp);
}
```

#### 2. Min Cost Climbing Stairs
You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1. Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

Input: cost = [10,15,20]

Output: 15

```cpp
int solve (vector<int> & cost, int idx, vector<int> & dp){
    if(idx>=0 and idx>=cost.size()) return 0;
    if(idx>=0 and dp[idx]!=-1) return dp[idx];

    int res1 = solve (cost, idx+1, dp);
    int res2 = solve (cost, idx+2, dp);

    int ans = min(res1, res2);
    ans += idx==-1 ? 0 : cost[idx];

    if(idx>=0) dp[idx] = ans;

    return ans;
}


int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
    vector<int> dp (cost.size(), -1);
    return solve (cost, -1, dp);
}
```

### Medium

#### 1. Predict the Winner
You are given an integer array nums. Two players are playing a game with this array. Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]

Output: true

```cpp
pair<int, int> solve (vector<int> & nums, bool player1, int start, int end, unordered_map<string, pair<int,int>> & dp){
    if(start>end) return {0,0};

    string key = to_string(start) + "-" + to_string(end);
    if(dp.find(key)!=dp.end())
        return dp[key];

    int p1_score = 0, p2_score = 0;

    /* Player has two choices, either to pick from start or from end */

    auto res1 = solve (nums, !player1, start, end-1, dp);
    auto res2 = solve (nums, !player1, start+1, end, dp);

    /* If current player is P1 then decision will be made by P1 (res.first) */

    if(player1){
        res1.first += nums[end];
        res2.first += nums[start];

        if(res1.first>res2.first){
            p1_score += res1.first;
            p2_score += res1.second;
        }
        else{
            p1_score += res2.first;
            p2_score += res2.second;
        }            
    }

    /* Else if current player is P2 then decision will made by P2 (res.second) */

    else{
        res1.second += nums[end];
        res2.second += nums[start];

        if(res1.second>res2.second){
            p1_score += res1.first;
            p2_score += res1.second;
        }
        else{
            p1_score += res2.first;
            p2_score += res2.second;
        }
    }

    return dp[key] = {p1_score, p2_score};
}


bool PredictTheWinner(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<string, pair<int,int>> dp;

    auto score = solve (nums, true, 0, nums.size()-1, dp);
    return score.first>=score.second;
}
```
