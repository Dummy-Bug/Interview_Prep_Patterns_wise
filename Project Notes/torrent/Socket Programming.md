# Socket Programming 

Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.

#### Stages for server:

1. Socket creation

2. Setsockopt (This helps in manipulating options for the socket referred by the file descriptor sockfd - helps in reuse of address and port)

3. Bind (binds the socket to the address and port number specified in addr)

4. Listen (It puts the server socket in a passive mode, where it waits for the client to approach the server to make a connection)

5. Accept (It extracts the first connection request on the queue of pending connections for the listening socket, sockfd, creates a new connected socket, and returns a new file descriptor referring to that socket. At this point, connection is established between client and server, and they are ready to transfer data)


#### Stages for Client:

1. Socket connection

2. Connect (The connect() system call connects the socket referred to by the file descriptor sockfd to the address specified by addr. Serverâ€™s address and port is specified in addr)
