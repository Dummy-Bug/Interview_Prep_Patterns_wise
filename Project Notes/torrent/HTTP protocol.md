## HTTP 

**Port: 80**

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a set of rule which is used for transferring data like, audio, video, images, text and other multimedia files on world wide web. HTTP does not have any security. HTTP transfers data in MIME format.

<br>

**HTTP 1.0**

1. HTTP 1.0 was designed to use a new TCP connection for every request.
2. Slow
3. High Latency

**HTTP 1.1**

1. Version 1.1 solved above problem with the use of persistent connections and pipelining requests on a persistent connection.
2. Low Latency
3. Streaming with chunked transfer (For example loading image part by part)

<br>

**HTTP Request Methods**

1. GET - This method retrieves information from the given server using a given URI
2. POST - The POST request sends the data to the server. For example, file upload, customer information, etc. using the HTML forms.
3. PUT - It is used to replace all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.
4. DELETE - It is used to remove all the current representations of the target resource, which is given by URI.
5. CONNECT - It is used to establish a tunnel to the server, which is identified by a given URI.

### How HTTP Works ?
A web server contains an HTTP daemon, a program that waits for HTTP requests and handles them when they arrive. A web browser is an HTTP client that sends requests to servers. When the user enters file requests by either "opening" a web file by typing in a URL or clicking on a hypertext link, the browser builds an HTTP request and sends it to the IP address indicated by the URL. The HTTP daemon in the destination server receives the request and sends back the requested file or files associated with the request.

When these request/response pairs are being sent, they use TCP/IP to reduce and transport information in small packets of binary sequences of ones and zeros. These packets are physically sent through electric wires, fiber optic cables and wireless networks.

## HTTPs

**Port: 443**

HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. Https transfers data in the encrypted format. Thus, https prevents hackers from reading and modifying the data during the transfer between the browser and web server. HTTPS established an encrypted link between the browser and the web server using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. 

To achieve this security in https, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is used because public keys can be used by several Web Browsers while private key can be used by the Web Server of that particular website. The distribution of these public keys is done via Certificates which are maintained by the Browser.

**Note:** It should be noted that this security in https is achieved at the cost of processing time because Web Server and Web Browser needs to exchange encryption keys using Certificates before actual data can be transferred.

<br>

**Secure Socket Layer (SSL)**

SSL ensures that the data transfer between the two systems remains encrypted and private. SSL establishes an encrypted link using an SSL certificate which is also known as a digital certificate. 

<br>

**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**

TLS is the evolved version of SSL. HTTPS is an implementation of TLS encryption on top of the HTTP protocol. Any website that uses HTTPS is therefore employing TLS encryption.

In TLS 1.2 we encrypt the data using some key at client side and same key will also be needed to decrypt that data. Now we before sending the encrypted data, we need to send the key to the server side. So we encrypt the key with server's public key (which can only be decrypted by server's private key as per assymmetric key cryptography). And then it transmit data to the server.

In TLS 1.3, Diffie Helman Key exchange algorithm is used to provide more security.

<br>

**What is SSL Certificate?**

An SSL certificate (also known as a TLS or SSL/TLS certificate) is a digital document that binds the identity of a website to a cryptographic key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The public key, included in the certificate, allows a web browser to initiate an encrypted communication session with a web server via the TLS and HTTPS protocols. The private key is kept secure on the server, and is used to digitally sign web pages and other documents (such as images and JavaScript files).

<br>

**Explain concept of Public and Private Keys**

It is possible to use the public key to encrypt a message that can only be decrypted with the private key. Furthermore, the holder of the private key can use it to sign other digital documents (such as web pages), and anyone with the public key can verify this signature.

## Interview Questions

#### 1. What is the Status Code?
HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:
1. Informational responses (100–199)
2. Successful responses (200–299)
3. Redirects (300–399)
4. Client errors (400–499)
5. Server errors (500–599)

<br>

#### 2. What are Persistent Connections?
In HTTP/1.0, the connection is closed after a single request or response pair. In HTTP/1.1, a mechanism was introduced, which is known as keep-alive-mechanism. In this mechanism, a connection could be reused for more than one request.

<br>

#### 3. What is Session State in HTTP?
Session state is also known as Stateless state. HTTP is a stateless protocol. In the session state, the client and server just know about each other only during the current request. If the connection is closed, and two computers want to connect again, they need to provide information to each other as a new connection, and the connection is handled as the very first one.

<br>

#### 4. What is HTTP Short polling ?
A lot of requests are processed as they come to the server, creating a lot of traffic. Below is an example of short polling.
 
```
00:00:00 C-> Is the cake ready? 
00:00:01 S-> No, wait.
00:00:01 C-> Is the cake ready?
00:00:02 S-> No, wait.
00:00:02 C-> Is the cake ready? 
00:00:03 S-> Yeah. Have some lad.
00:00:03 C-> Is the other cake ready?
```

<br>

#### 5. What is HTTP Long polling ?
With HTTP long-polling, the client continually polls the server requesting for new information. The server hold the request open until any new data is available, and responds with the new information once available. In essence, the client is constantly polling the server to see if the database has changed state. As soon as the client receives that new information, it can immediately send another request and the operation is continually repeated.

<br>

#### 6. What is Periodic polling ?
There’s a predefined time gap between two requests. This is an improved version of polling. You can reduce server consumption by increasing the time gap between two requests. But if you need to be notified with no delay when the server event happens, this is not a good option.

<br>

#### 7. What is HTTP Streaming ?
The client makes an HTTP request, and the server trickles out a response of indefinite length (it’s like polling infinitely). It can be an alternative to WebSockets. The only issue with streaming is that, Intermediaries can interrupt the connection e.g. timeout, intermediaries serving other requests in a round-robin manner.

```
00:00:00 CLIENT-> I need cakes 
00:00:01 SERVER-> Cake-1 is in process.
00:00:02 SERVER-> Have cake-1.
00:00:02 SERVER-> Wait for cake-2.
00:00:03 SERVER-> Cake-2 is in process.
00:00:04 SERVER-> Have cake-2.
00:00:04 SERVER-> Wait for cake-3.
00:00:05 CLIENT-> Enough, I'm full.
```

<br>

#### 8. What is SSE (Server Sent Events / EventSource) ?
SSE connections can only push data to the browser. Communication is carried out from server to browser only, browsers can only subscribe to data updates originated by the server, but cannot send any data to the server. It is used in push notifications, twitter updates, cricket score updates etc.

<br>

#### 9. What is HTTP/2 Server Push ?
A mechanism for a server to proactively push assets (stylesheets, scripts, media) to the client cache in advance. It is used in Social media feeds, single-page apps etc.

<br>

#### 10. What are advantages of web sockets over HTTP ?
WebSockets allow both the server and the client to push messages at any time. WebSocket solves a few issues with HTTP:

1. Bi-directional protocol : either client/server can send a message to the other party (In HTTP, the request is always initiated by the client and the response is processed by the server, making HTTP a uni-directional protocol)

2. Full-duplex communication : client and server can talk to each other independently at the same time.

<br>

#### 11. HTTP is not always REstfull. How ?
1. REST is not a communications protocol, while HTTP is.
2. Most modern web servers use cookies and sessions to store state. This violates the principle of statelessness.
